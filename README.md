# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in movie reviews using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the IMDB Reviews Dataset, which contains labeled reviews as either positive or negative. The goal is to preprocess text, train machine learning models, and develop an interactive web app for sentiment prediction.

Features: Data Processing: Text preprocessing including tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization. Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB and Random Forest with TF-IDF vectorization. Model Evaluation: Accuracy and F1-score used to assess performance. Interactive Web App: Built with Streamlit for user-friendly sentiment analysis. Real-Time Predictions: Enter a movie review and get instant results.

Dataset Includes: Movie reviews labeled as positive or negative
